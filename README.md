The repository of paper - BOLD3D: A 3D BOLD descriptor for 6Dof pose estimation

The source code is coming soon.

Introduction
In this paper, we present a novel and efficient method to estimate the 6DoF pose of mechanical parts under occluded or cluttered scenes. Effective and discriminating local features on the edge for partial geometric structure representation are introduced. A valid hash-based acceleration procedure is performed for reducing time consumption in the feature space searching process.
